## Introduction

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control, allowing multiple people to work on projects simultaneously. It hosts your code, tracks revisions, and facilitates collaboration. In this guide, we will cover basic GitHub commands and workflows that you can use in your development projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://github.com/join).
- Git installed on your local machine. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Setting Up Git

To start using Git, you need to configure your Git environment. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
